this repo provides docker image with the root fs of the very first raspbian release based on debian located as an image dump at 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/2012-07-15-wheezy-raspbian/

only trick that has been done is /etc/apt/sources.list is now pointed to http://legacy.raspbian.org since, wheezy is eol for raspbian.
